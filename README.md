# My First React App
**Website:** https://rebeckajohansson94.github.io/my-first-react-app/

## Description
This project is the starting point of a responsive React-based layout. It includes a navigation bar, a sidebar for desktop view, and a mobile menu (which combines the sidebar and navbar into a hamburger menu) – built with reusable components and styled with CSS. The goal is to build a complete application layout that will be expanded with more functionality and content.


## Structure
- `App.jsx` – The root component that renders the layout
- `Navbar.jsx` – Top navigation bar, includes mobile menu toggle
- `MobileMenu.jsx` – Responsive mobile navigation menu
- `Sidebar.jsx` – A sidebar shown on desktop view
- `SidebarButton.jsx` – Reusable button component used in sidebar and mobile view
- `NavLinks.jsx` – Array of shared navigation links
- `index.css` – Global and responsive styling
