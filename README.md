# My First React App

## Description
This project is the starting point of a responsive React-based layout. It includes a navigation bar, a sidebar for desktop view, and a mobile menu (which combines the sidebar and navbar into a single hamburger menu) – built with reusable components and styled with CSS. The goal is to build a complete application layout that will be expanded further with more functionality and content.


## Structure
- `**App.jsx**` – The root component that defines the layout
- `**main.jsx**` – Renders the App component into the DOM
- `**index.css**` – Global and responsive CSS styling
- `assets/**background-img.jpg**` – The background image used in the app
- `Components/Navbar/**Navbar.jsx**` – Navigation bar, includes mobile menu toggle
- `Components/Navbar/**NavLinks.jsx**` – Array of shared navigation links used in Navbar and MobileMenu
- `Components/Reponsive/**MobileMenu.jsx**` – Responsive navigation menu for mobile view
- `Components/Sidebar/**Sidebar.jsx**` – A sidebar shown on desktop view only
- `Components/Sidebar/**SidebarButton.jsx**` – Reusable button component used in sidebar and mobile view
